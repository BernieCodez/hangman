# How To Play + Tips
If you don't know how to play hangman then well... you should know. I suppose thats why you're here. Anyhow, here's how its played:
A man is about to be hanged (hence the name 'hangman') and you must prevent him from getting hanged. You will be given a word and you must guess all the letters in the word. However if you guess a wrong  letter, the man well grow close to his death. If you guess 7 wrong letters the man is killed and you lose. Good luck!

Here are some tips to help you out!
Start by guessing the vowels. Most words have at least 1 vowel.
Guess common letters like r s and t.
Then guess the less common letters like c and n
